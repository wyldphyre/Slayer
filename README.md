Slayer
======

If you find yourself regularly needing to kill a certain kind of process, this application can make it quicker and easier to do so.

I built this to provide a quick way to kill processes that, for one reason or another, I found myself needing to kill on a regular or semi-regular basis. The primary goal was that it should provide a way to select which process to kill if there was more than one of them running (the tool I was previously using would just kill all running instances of an executable).

## Setup

The simplest way to setup is to pin the .exe file to your taskbar and then run it. The first time Slayer is run it will install a default configuration file which you can modify by opening the jump menu (right click on the taskbar icon after executing the exe at least once) and selecting **"Edit configuration"**. It is also possible to pass parameters to Slayer.exe. I'll cover that in future documentation.

### TODO: 
* Document use of the configuration file
* Document command line switches
