Slayer
======

If you find yourself regularly needing to kill a certain kind of process, this application can make it quicker and easier to do so.

I built this to provide myself a quick way to kill processes I often needed to kill during the development process. The primary goal was that it should provide a way to select which process to kill if there was more than one of them running (the tool I was previously using would just kill all running instances of an executable).

## Setup

The simplest way to setup is to pin the .exe file to your taskbase in Windows and then clicking on it. Nothing will happen at this point, but the default configuration file will be put in place. Right clicking on the taskbar button will provide a jump list of the processes that it has been configured to be able to kill. It is also possible to pass parameters to Slayer.exe directly.

* Cover setup and use of the configuration file
